Major Applications of MapReduce:
========================
1. Query Log Processing
2. Crawling, indexing and searching
3. Analytics, Text Processing and sentiment analysis
4. Machine Learning (Bayes and markov)
5. Recommendation systems
6. Document clustering and classfication
7. Bioinformatics
8. Genome analysis (biomarker analysis, regrssion algorithms such as linear and cox)

Note:
   DNA-Sequencing
	Reading a patientâ€˜s blood sample (as input) and generating variants (output) for a DNA sample.

Secondary-sort
	Hadoop automatically sorts data emitted by mappers before being sent to reducers, what can you do if you also want to sort by value? 
	You use secondary sorting of course.
         Two possible approaches here.
		1. In-reducer Sort
		2. creating composite key
	for Ref : https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/01/mapreduce-algorithms-secondary-sorting.html

Approach-2:
	
      	In Hadoop, 
			1. to persist custom data types they have to implement the Writable interface
			2. To compare custom data types, then they have to implement an additional interface called WritableComparable.
			3. Partitioner decides which mapper output goes to which reduer based on mapper output key
